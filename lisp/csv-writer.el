;;  Convert alists to CSV data.

;;  This is complementary to Ulf Jasper's csv.el, which converts CSV files to alists.
;;  If you want to edit csv files manually, you might be interested in Francis Wright's csv-mode.el

;;  Main routine is `csv-insert-data' which takes a list
;;  of alists and inserts it as CSV (Comma Separated Value) data into the current buffer.
;;  The first line of the CSV file contains the list of
;;  keys.  For example:

;;  ((("Key1" "Value1a") ("Key 2" "Value1b") ("Key3" "Value1c"))
;;   (("Key1" "Value2a") ("Key 2" "Value2b") ("Key3" "Very long Value
;;    2c")))

;;  gets translated into

;;  Key1,Key 2,"Key3"
;;  Value1a,Value1b,"Value1c"
;;  Value2a,Value2b,"Very long Value
;;  2c"
